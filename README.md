# sqlalchemy-challenge

I have created the folder called SurfsUp and added the Resources folder in there, with all the necessary files. The only file that I have not included yet is the 
jupyter notebook file because it is just filled with a lot of error messages. I will continue to work on this assignment and resubmit it with the jupyter notebook 
file included at a later time.
